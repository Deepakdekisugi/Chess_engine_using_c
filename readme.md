# VICE Chess Engine

## Overview

VICE is a powerful open-source chess engine developed in the C programming language. It supports various chess functionalities, including XBoard and UCI protocols, move generation, position evaluation, and advanced search algorithms.

## Compilation

To compile the VICE Chess Engine, use the provided Makefile with the following command:

```bash
make
```

This will invoke the GCC compiler with the necessary source files and optimization flags, generating the executable named `vice`.

## Usage

Run the compiled `vice` executable to start the chess engine. The engine supports both XBoard and UCI protocols for communication with graphical chess interfaces.

```bash
./vice
```

The engine will await commands from the interface and provide responses, allowing users to play games, analyze positions, and more.

## Features

- **XBoard and UCI Support:** VICE Chess Engine supports both XBoard and UCI protocols for compatibility with various chess interfaces.
- **Advanced Search Algorithms:** The engine employs sophisticated search algorithms to find the best move in a given position.
- **Position Evaluation:** VICE evaluates chess positions using a comprehensive evaluation function.
- **Polyglot Opening Book:** The engine utilizes a polyglot opening book for enhanced opening play.

## File Structure

- `xboard.c`: Handles XBoard protocol communication.
- `vice.c`: Main file containing the entry point for the chess engine.
- `uci.c`: Implements the Universal Chess Interface (UCI) communication.
- ... (and other source files)
